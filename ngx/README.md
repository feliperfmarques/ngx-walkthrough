# ngx-walkthrough

Update of https://github.com/souly1/ng-walkthrough for angular > 5

One of the most common design challenges emerging in mobile design is that of 'invitation' - creating an explanation walk through during user first interaction with the app so to engage him.
Following Theresa Neil's design patterns from [Mobile Design Pattern Gallery] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449314325/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=uxbo09-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399373&creativeASIN=1449314325)

This angular component implements a walkthrough via one of the following patterns: the transparency pattern or the tip pattern (an explanation about the different patterns can be found online at [ux booth](http://www.uxbooth.com/articles/mobile-design-patterns/))

Get the [Changelog](https://github.com/Altaba77/ngx-walkthrough/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

# Special features

 - Use the transparency walkthrough either using transclude or given attributes which contain basics such as text, gesture image, 'got it' button
 - In transparency walkthrough easily highlight a DOM element (see demo)
 - Use any image you want or choose a gesture image from the given collection (such as swipe with direction or tap) and place it bound to the element mentioned above.
 - automatically moves text to bottom if item is covering the text with icon or arrow
 - In tip mode add an Icon to sit on top or behind the tip text box

## ScreenShots

# Demo

A demo of the previous version was created to show (**Note**: that the attributes have been changed, see example bellow):
 * The 2 basic transparency overlay types in 3 demoes fitting the screenshot examples -  one basic template, one with arrows, and the last freestyle one using transclude.
 * The tip mode walkthrough

## Requirements

- Angular 5 or superior

## Installation

* **NPM**: `npm install ngx-walkthrough`
* **Bower**: `bower install ngx-walkthrough`

## Usage

Import the module in your appplication module

```ts
import { WalkthroughModule } from 'ngx-walkthrough';
```

then declare it in your app imports:

```ts
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { WalkthroughModule } from 'ngx-walkthrough';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    WalkthroughModule
  ],
  declarations: [ AppComponent ],
  bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

You can now use the component, add the element to your HTML:
```html
<walkthrough [walkthrough-type]="'X'">
  ...
</walkthrough>
```
and use one of the two configurations:
    1> Place any HTML code as you like instead of the three dotes as this uses the Angular transclude ability. Make sure to specify [walkthrough-type]="transparency" or "tip" for this to work.
    2> Use the additional optional properties the component has to quickly create a walkthrough screen.

## Usage Example 1 - transparency Non transclude option

```html
<walkthrough
            [is-round]="true"
            [walkthrough-type]="'transparency'"
            [focus-element-selector]="'#focusItem'"
            [icon]="'single_tap'"
            [main-caption]="'This is some text'"
            [is-active]="true"
            [use-button]="true">
</walkthrough>
```

## Usage Example 2 - transparency using transclude option

```html
<walkthrough [is-active]="true" [walkthrough-type]="'transparency'">
  <img src="images/ImageTutorialExample.png" style="height: 100vh; width: 100%;">
</walkthrough>
```

## Usage Example 3 - tip type walkthrough

```html
<walkthrough
            [walkthrough-type]="'tip'"
            [icon]="'images/myLogo.png'"
            [tip-icon-location]="'FRONT'"
            [tip-location]="'TOP'"
            [main-caption]="'This is some text'"
            [tip-color]="'BLACK'"
            [is-active]="true"
            [use-button]="true">
</walkthrough>
```

## Usage Example 4 - transparency Non transclude option full code with output
```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { AngularFirestore } from 'angularfire2/firestore';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  template: `
    <walkthrough
                [is-round]="true"
                [walkthrough-type]="'transparency'"
                [focus-element-selector]="'#focusItem'"
                [icon]="'arrow'"
                [main-caption]="'This is some text'"
                [is-active]="true"
                [use-button]="true"
                (on-walkthrough-show)="myShowFunction()"
                (on-walkthrough-hide)="myHideFunction()">
    </walkthrough>
  `
})
export class MyApp {
  constructor() {
  }
  myShowFunction(){
    console.log("show event");
  }
   myHideFunction(){
    console.log("hide event");
  }
}
```
